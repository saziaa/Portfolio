## ðŸ“š Selected Projects
1. **Industrial Air Pollution & Lung Cancer in Canada (2002â€“2023)**  
   - Integrated NPRI industrial emissions with Statistics Canada lung cancer incidence data.  
   - Built predictive models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Prophet) and applied DLNM-GAM to project province-wise cancer cases.  
   - Applied Apriori algorithm with permutation testing for pollutant co-occurrence analysis.  
   - Developed an interactive **Tableau dashboard** for data visualization.  

2. **Deep Learning Insights into Social Determinants of Chronic Disease and Longevity** (Collaborative Project) 
   - Modeled global chronic disease mortality trends using WHO and World Bank data.  
   - Developed XGBoost, GRU, LSTM models with 3-fold cross-validation.  
   - Used SHAP for interpretability of socioeconomic predictors like income inequality and diabetes prevalence.  

3. **Lightweight Deep Learning for Alzheimerâ€™s Stage Classification**  
   - Fine-tuned VGG16 on MRI scans to classify Alzheimerâ€™s stages.
   - Enhanced accuracy through augmentation, class balancing, and ablation studies
   - Applied Grad-CAM for interpretability and improved accuracy with augmentation and class balancing.  

4. **Energy Consumption Forecasting at East Melbourne Wastewater Plant**  
   - Analyzed historical plant data and environmental parameters.  
   - Compared traditional, ensemble, and deep learning models to optimize energy demand forecasting.

5. **Sales Prediction for Pharmaceutical Distribution Companies**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis on pharmaceutical sales datasets and prepared data for modeling
   - Developed time series forecasting models (SARIMA, Prophet, SVR) in Python and compared performance using RMSE
   - Predicted short-term sales with high accuracy; Prophet model outperformed SARIMA and SVR, demonstrating strong Python-based data processing skills
